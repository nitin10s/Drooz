<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>
    Drowsiness is a condition which diminishes the
    awareness caused by the absence of rest or weariness.
    Because of weariness, driver lose their control which may
    divert them from the street and prompts serious mishaps.
    Basically these mishaps may because of the driver tired
    condition. Driving continuosly for quite a while prompts
    tiredness and make them to lost their awareness. Due to
    substantial increment in the number of mischances day by
    day which makes a major issues. 
</p>
<p>
    Driver drowsiness detection is a car safety Technology which helps prevent accidents caused by the driver getting drowsy. Various         studies have suggested that around 20% of all road accidents are fatigue-related, up to 50% on certain roads
    Some of the current systems learn driver patterns and can detect when a driver is becoming drowsy.
</p>


<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
    The goal of
    this project is to monitor driver's exhaustion progressively.
    One of the identification procedure is Percentage of squinting of eyes.
    Here we utilize a system totally in view of the development
    of eyes. The perception of eye development is essentially in
    view of the driver's condition.
</p>

<p>
    As of now, a threshold hard-coded EAR is fed to the system that is used to detect if the user is
    drowsy or not which is medically incorrect. The fatigue level should be monitored on various
    parameters like:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Percentage Long Closure</li>
    <li>Blink Total Duration</li>
    <li>Inter-Event Duration</li>
</ol>
